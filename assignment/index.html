        For #6 did we want it to read example 'Removed -6 parts.' or 'Removed 6
        parts.' Included code for both.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also on #6 a thought crosses my mind. Would we ever want to include a
        "catch" of sorts in case, for example, 'eleven' as a string were
        accidently entered into the array upstream instead of number 11. have an
        empty array "supplyChangesCatch" and push anything to it that is not a
        number and then tie some sort of alert or email. I assume the "catch"
        would be included in whatever form the information was entered on to
        require only numbers to be entered, just a thought.
      </li>

        Last thing, your suggestion on commits. In this case I cloned the repo,
        completed the assignment, and performed only 1 commit. I feel you may be
        looking for more commits, for example maybe I should commit after each
        question I answer. The difficult part in this situation is this feels
        like a quiz/test so i'm approaching it like that; clear time, sit down,
        answer questions, submit. I think this will naturaly change as we get to
        larger "project" like works. However I recognize the lack of commits on
        this weeks assignments and will intentionally commit more in the future
        even on test like assignments.
